# RealTimeFaceRecognition
In this code, we simply finished the following sense:
1. using the opencv or dlib to detect human-faces
2. Recogtition the face in real time with fine-tuned VGG face model on Movidius ncs
3. record the recognition result to redis database;
4. there is a faceApp subscribed the event above and do the validation of an known person
5. if the face is known, unlock the door-locker which is enveloped as an OCF device

Note: this sense has been performed on RaspberryPI + Intel Movidius ncs + Wulian smart home devices.
